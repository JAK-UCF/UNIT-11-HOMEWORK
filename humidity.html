        <h1>Summary: Latitude vs. Humidity</h1>

        <p class="intro">Humidity data collected on July 13, 2019, displays a nice visualization of the Coriolis Effect.</p>
        <p>The area between the Tropic of Cancer at 30° North and Tropic of Capricorn at 30° South is generally referred to as the Tropics. The Equator is half way between at 0° latitude. The Tropics are where the sun shines directly down onto, not at an angle to, the earth's surface. This direct sunlight causes significant evaporation of the ground and ocean water and leads to higher humidity levels.</p>
        <p>The Coriolis Effect creates convection cells and moves warm moist air up into the atmosphere and toward the respective 30° latitude. As the air in the Tropics rises and cools, it releases moisture as precipitation (cyclically) and the air maintains fairly high relative humidity. As the now cool dry air descends near the 30° latitude lines of each hemisphere, it warms and expands resulting in a somewhat 'dehydrating' effect.</p>
        <p>In the humidity plot, observe that nearer the 30° latitudes are where the lowest humidities are recorded. Also notice the higher levels of humidity as you approach the midpoint. With higher temperatures in the northern hemisphere due to summer, it is natural to see slightly more humidity. The Coriolis Effect results in many of the worlds deserts and being located near the 30th latitudes.</p>
